# Contracts: server / CLI flags + env vars

Split out of `CONTRACTS.md` (2026-08-02) — see that file for the index of all contract planes and
the rest of the surface (HTTP, on-disk, agent-facing).

Two binaries live here:

- **`cmd/agent-bus`** — the SERVER.
- **`cmd/busctl`** — the CLIENT, added 2026-08-02 by CLI-1/CLI-2. Per the amended invariant 7 it
  **replaces the `scripts/bus-*.sh` wrappers** as their subcommands land. Its flags, exit codes and
  JSON shapes are a contract with two consumers — a human and an agent shelling out — plus a third,
  an agent **embedding** the Go package it is a thin shell over.

---

## CLI flags (`cmd/agent-bus`)

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-listen` | `127.0.0.1:8080` | TCP address to bind (loopback-only by default; use `:8080` for all interfaces) |
| `-data-dir` | `./data` | Directory for the durable store + append-only log; created `0700` if missing |
| `-poll-timeout` | `30s` | Ceiling on a single long-poll wait (not yet consumed by any handler) |
| `-log-level` | `info` | `debug`, `warn`, `info`, or `error` |
| `-bus-id` | *(empty → placeholder `bus-local`)* | **TEST-ONLY.** Validated against `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$`; `.` rejected (qualification separator, invariant 2). Using it logs a runtime `WARN`. See `DECISIONS.md`. |

Exit codes: `2` on invalid flags/config (`parseFlags`/`validate` failure), `1` on a startup failure
(e.g. bind failure), `0` on a clean signal-driven shutdown.

---

## `cmd/busctl` — the client

Binary directory `cmd/busctl`; the importable package it shells over is
`github.com/dodgymike/agent-bus/client` (top-level, deliberately **not** under `internal/` — see
"The client package" below).

```
busctl [flags] <command> [flags]
```

Global flags are accepted **before or after** the subcommand, so both `busctl --json enrol …` and
`busctl enrol --json …` work.

### Global flags

| Flag | Env | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--bus <url>` | `AGENT_BUS_URL` | *(the selected identity's recorded URL; `enrol` requires it explicitly)* | Base URL of the bus. `https` anywhere; **`http` ONLY to a loopback host** (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`) — see "In flight" below. A path prefix is allowed; **userinfo, query and fragment are rejected**. Canonicalised: host lower-cased, default port dropped, trailing `/` trimmed. |
| `--identity <dir>` | `AGENT_BUS_IDENTITY` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agent-bus` (`os.UserConfigDir()` + `/agent-bus`) | The credential store **DIRECTORY** — not an agent id. |
| `--as <agent-id>` | `AGENT_BUS_AGENT_ID` | *(the stored selection)* | Act as one stored identity for this command only, changing nothing on disk. **Parallel agents sharing a store should use this, not `use`.** |
| `--json` | — | off | Machine-readable JSON on stdout. |
| `--timeout <dur>` | `AGENT_BUS_TIMEOUT` | `30s` | Bounds ONE operation end to end, retries included. Any `time.ParseDuration` value; must be positive. |

**Resolution order, deterministic:** explicit flag → environment variable → the selected identity's
recorded value (`--bus` only) → built-in default.

`--help` / `-h` / `busctl help <command>` print help and exit `0`.

### Subcommands (as of 2026-08-02)

| Command | Purpose | Network? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enrol --name <name>` | Generate an Ed25519 key pair, send only the public half, receive the server-minted `<bus-id>.<agent-id>`, store the credential | yes — `POST /v1/enroll` |
| `whoami [--all] [--verify]` | Show the identity commands act as; `--all` lists them; `--verify` performs a real session handshake | only with `--verify` |
| `use <agent-id\|name>` | Change the stored selection | no |
| `logout [<agent-id>] [--all]` | Delete a credential **locally** | no |

`enrol` flags: `--name` (required), `--invite` (**reserved, currently rejected** — see below),
`--idempotency-key` (resume an earlier attempt), `--keep-current` (do not switch the selection).

**`logout` is LOCAL ONLY.** `/v1/leave` does not exist yet, so nothing is revoked: the enrolment
stays on the roster and any live session lives out its hour. The JSON field `server_notified` reports
this honestly and is `false` today.

### Exit codes — CONTRACT

An agent branches on these, so a value never changes meaning and a retired value is never reused.
They are produced by `client.ExitCode(err)` in the importable package, so an embedder gets the same
codes without copying a switch.

| Code | Kind | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | — | Success |
| `1` | `internal` | Unclassified/internal failure |
| `2` | `usage` | Malformed invocation: bad flag, missing `--name`, unknown subcommand, reserved `--invite` |
| `3` | `config` | Local identity/config not ready: nothing enrolled, no selection, unreadable or damaged store |
| `4` | `auth` | The bus rejected the credential (401/403), or the signature did not verify |
| `5` | `network` | The bus could not be reached: refused, DNS, timeout, or a certificate that does not verify |
| `6` | `server` | The bus reported a failure of its own (5xx), or a capacity refusal that survived retries |
| `7` | `rejected` | The bus understood the request and refused it (400/404/409/413/415/422) |
| `8` | `empty` | Succeeded with **nothing to report** (e.g. `whoami --all` on an empty store) |

`2` is usage rather than `1` to match Go's `flag` package and `cmd/agent-bus`.

### JSON shapes — CONTRACT

**Success** — exactly ONE JSON object on stdout, keys sorted, plus `"ok": true`:

```json
{"agent_id":"bus-abc.planner-1","bus_id":"bus-abc","bus_url":"https://127.0.0.1:8080",
 "enrolled_at":"2026-08-02T22:10:24.217971827Z","name":"planner","ok":true,
 "public_key":"KouoAWExNgv14Dh4sg/h/AnDXw/tn583vbvCCyO01Rs=","replayed":false,
 "store_path":"/home/u/.config/agent-bus/identities.json","stored":true}
```

| Command | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `enrol` | `agent_id`, `bus_id`, `name`, `bus_url`, `public_key`, `enrolled_at`, `replayed`, `idempotency_key`, `stored`, `store_path` |
| `whoami` | the identity fields above, plus `is_current` (bool), and `session` (`agent_id`, `expires_at`, `refresh_at`, `lifetime_seconds`) with `--verify` |
| `whoami --all` | `identities` (array), `current_agent_id` (string), and `pending` (array of `idempotency_key`/`name`/`bus_url`/`created_at`) when any enrolment is unfinished |
| `use` | the identity fields, plus `is_current` (bool) |
| `logout` | `removed` (array of agent ids), `current_agent_id` (string), `server_notified` |

**`is_current` is a bool; `current_agent_id` is a string.** They are deliberately different keys: one
name that is a bool in one subcommand and a string in another makes `jq .current` unpredictable.

**Failure** — one JSON object on **stdout** in `--json` mode (so a consumer parses one stream), or
two human lines on **stderr** otherwise:

```json
{"ok":false,"error":"enrol: cannot reach the bus at http://127.0.0.1:8080","kind":"network",
 "remedy":"check --bus / AGENT_BUS_URL and that the bus is running","exit_code":5}
```

`status` is added when the failure carried an HTTP status.

**NDJSON — the streaming convention, fixed now.** A streaming subcommand (the long poll, when it
lands) writes **one compact JSON object per line, flushed as it arrives**, with **no envelope, no
`ok` field and no array brackets**, so a consumer can act on each record incrementally instead of
buffering to completion. Diagnostics never go to stdout.

### Credential storage

| Path | Mode | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<identity-dir>/` | `0700` | The store. Tightened on open if it already exists looser. |
| `<identity-dir>/identities.json` | `0600` | Format version `1`. Enrolled identities **including Ed25519 private-key seeds**, the current selection, and in-flight (`pending`) enrolments. |
| `<identity-dir>/identities.lock` | `0600` | Exclusive lock for read-modify-write; treated as abandoned after 30s. |

Written by atomic replace: an `O_EXCL` `0600` temp file in the same directory, fsynced, renamed, then
the directory fsynced. Abandoned temp files are swept on the next write — each is a complete copy of
every private key. **Never inside the repository.**

The lock carries an ownership token (pid + 16 random bytes); a stale break removes only the exact
file it observed as stale, and a release removes only a lock that is still its own. Without that,
two processes breaking one abandoned lock could both believe they held it and one whole-file
update — one private key — would be lost.

A store directory or credential file found at looser permissions is TIGHTENED **and a warning is
printed to stderr**: a key file that was ever readable by another local user must be assumed
compromised, and silently fixing the mode destroys the only evidence.

**Session tokens are never written to disk.** They are bearer credentials with at most an hour of
life that do not survive a bus restart, so persisting them would trade a stealable token at rest for
two saved round trips. Each `busctl` process performs its own handshake.

### Enrolment idempotency (invariant 10)

The key pair is written to the store as a `pending` record **before** `/v1/enroll` is called, so a
process killed after the bus minted an id does not lose the private key. Records are scoped to
**(idempotency key, bus URL)** — the same scoping the server uses — so:

- re-running an enrolment with the same `--idempotency-key` and name is answered **from the store**,
  with `"replayed": true` and **no HTTP request**;
- the same key with a different name on the same bus is refused **locally**, exit `2`, because the
  bus's answer to that is a 409 **and a disconnection**;
- the same key against a different bus is a fresh enrolment;
- a network failure keeps the record and the error names the exact `--idempotency-key <key>` that
  resumes it; `whoami --all` lists every unfinished enrolment with the command that resumes it, so a
  process killed before it printed anything still leaves a recoverable identity;
- pending records are pruned 24h after creation, on the next store write, and are destroyed
  outright by `logout --all`.

The claim decision — already applied / resume / start new — is made in ONE locked read-modify-write.
Two concurrent enrolments under one key would otherwise both generate a key pair, and one private key
would be lost while both sent conflicting payloads under the same key.

### In flight — what will change

- **`--invite` is RESERVED and currently rejected** (exit `2`) rather than guessed. Enrolment is
  becoming invite-only (invariant 3) and the blob will carry bus id, address, **bus-certificate
  fingerprint** and invite secret — but the wire shape is settled by task `ENROL-SHAPE`, and
  `/v1/enroll` is explicitly UNSTABLE until it, certificate binding and POPKEY all land. Inventing a
  field name here would be the same mistake as hand-picking a record-type number.
- **TLS** (invariant 11): `http://` is accepted **only to a loopback host**, and only because the bus
  does not serve TLS yet. Plaintext to anything else is refused, because `/v1/session/begin` returns
  the session token — a bearer credential — in a response body. That restriction is the client-side
  half of E8's sequencing constraint ("the bus must NOT be exposed on a non-loopback interface before
  mTLS lands") and is DELETED once the TLS listener ships. When it does, certificates are
  self-signed, mutual, and pinned from the invite with **no TOFU**. The whole transport is one seam
  (`client.newHTTPClient`) so pinning drops in there and nowhere else. `InsecureSkipVerify` is not
  set, is not reachable through `Config`, and appears in no `.go` file in the tree — a test asserts
  it. Redirects are never followed, because Go's default policy would forward the `Authorization`
  header across an `https`→`http` downgrade on the same port.
- **The transport is built before the identity is resolved**, which will need revisiting: pinning
  needs a per-identity client certificate and a per-bus fingerprint, neither of which is a function
  of `Config` alone. Filed as a follow-up; the seam is in the right place, at the wrong time.

### The client package (`github.com/dodgymike/agent-bus/client`)

Top-level, **not** under `internal/`: invariant 7's third audience is an agent that EMBEDS the
client, and Go forbids another module from importing an `internal/` path, so the requirement would be
silently foreclosed by a directory name. Its exported surface is a public API subject to
compatibility care, and it must **not** import anything under `internal/` — mechanically enforced by
CLI-1's proof clause `! go list -deps ./cmd/busctl | grep -q 'agent-bus/internal/'`.

Constants shared with the server are **pinned literals** with a comment naming the server-side
definition they mirror (`client.SessionSigningContext`, `client.AgentNamePattern`, the route paths).
Divergence fails closed — a signature simply does not verify.

Exported surface as of 2026-08-02:

| Symbol | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Config`, `DefaultConfig`, `Config.ApplyEnv`, `DefaultIdentityDir`, `RetryPolicy`, `HTTPDoer` | Configuration and the transport escape hatch |
| `EnvBusURL`, `EnvIdentityDir`, `EnvAgentID`, `EnvTimeout` | The env var names above |
| `DefaultTimeout`, `DefaultRetryAttempts`, `DefaultRetryBaseDelay`, `DefaultRetryMaxDelay` | Defaults |
| `New`, `Client` | The client; `Config()`, `Store()`, `Identity()`, `Identities()`, `Use()`, `Logout()`, `LogoutAll()`, `Enrol()`, `EnsureSession()` |
| `Identity`, `Credential`, `PendingEnrolment`, `Store` (`OpenStore`, `Dir`, `Path`, `Warnings`, `List`, `ListPending`, `Resolve`, `SetCurrent`, `Remove`, `RemoveAll`, `FindApplied`, `PromotePending`) | Credential storage. The in-flight-enrolment methods that take the unexported record type (`ClaimEnrolment`, `FindPending`, `DropPending`) are effectively package-internal and are NOT part of the embeddable surface. |
| `EnrolOptions`, `EnrolResult`, `SessionInfo`, `LogoutResult` | Operation inputs and results |
| `Error`, `Kind` (+ the `Kind*` constants), `KindOf`, `ExitCode`, `ErrorPayload`, `NewErrorPayload`, the `Exit*` constants | Errors and the exit-code contract |
| `SessionSigningContext`, `AgentNamePattern` | Pinned protocol constants |

`Identity` is the redacted public half and `Credential` is `Identity` plus the secret seed; the split
is structural, so no rendering path can marshal a private key by forgetting a redaction step.
`Credential.String()` redacts. `SessionInfo` has **no token field at all**, not even a `json:"-"` one.

## Env vars

| Var | Consumed by | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENT_BUS_URL` | `busctl` | Bus base URL (`--bus`) |
| `AGENT_BUS_IDENTITY` | `busctl` | Credential store directory (`--identity`) |
| `AGENT_BUS_AGENT_ID` | `busctl` | Act as this stored identity (`--as`) |
| `AGENT_BUS_TIMEOUT` | `busctl` | Per-operation timeout (`--timeout`) |

`cmd/agent-bus` still reads no environment variables; every server knob is a flag.
(`scripts/bus-serve.sh` has its own `AGENT_BUS_RUN_DIR` / `AGENT_BUS_DATA_DIR` / `AGENT_BUS_LISTEN`
/ `AGENT_BUS_LOG_LEVEL` / `AGENT_BUS_POLL_TIMEOUT` — those are the wrapper's, not the binary's, and
are documented in `CONTRACTS-AGENT.md`.)
